[{"content":"Alpha GO A computer program called AlphaGo has beaten Lee Sedol, a master player In the ancient Chinese board game of Go in a landmark moment for AI.\nIn Go two player take turns in placing black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. To win you need to surround your opponent\u0026rsquo;s pieces. It is a more complex challenge for a computer than chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe - and players rely on human instinct as much as strategy. Most experts had considered defeating a Go champion beyond the present capacity of artificial intelligence.\nWhen IBM\u0026rsquo;s Deep Blue supercomputer beat world chess champion Gerry Kasparov in 1907, the victory was not due to human-like intelligence: it won by the brute force of its processing power, searching through millions of moves in seconds.However, the complexity of Go requires a completely different approach.Processing power is not enough to beat a Go champion of the calibre of Lee Sedol.\nAlphaGo, developed by a company called DeepMind, was designed to adopt an intuitive, human-like style of gameplay. It followed a technique called \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo;, which imitates the workings of the human brain to allow a program to develop by teaching itself through trial and error. Rather than programming rules and strategies, DeepMind designer taught AlphaGo to play the game by feeding it data based on typical Go moves. Then AlphaGo played against itself, millions of times, learning from its mistakes and getting better each time. Deep learning changes the relationship humans have with their technological creations, It results in Al that displays surprising and unpredictable behaviour Lee Sedol described being stunned by one unconventional move from AlphaGo which no human would ever have made. In traditional computer programming the aim is to anticipate all possible eventualities and a surprise means that something needs to be fixed. With deep learning, unpredictability and surprises may indicate that the program has found a better way of doing something than its human creators had ever imagined. In the coming years, AlphaGo will continue to learn and to improve, surprising and teaching humans new moves and strategies.\nOther Al programs, also based on deep leaming and unpredictability, could be designed to overtake human abilities in highly complex tasks: diagnosing illness, managing power grids, protecting against cyber threat. All of this has enormous implications for the future development of Al and our ability to control it.\nWhy s GO described as the \u0026lsquo;Holy Grail\u0026rsquo; (Santo Graal) of computer games? \r ","description":"","id":0,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Alpha Go","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/artificial-intelligence/alpha-go/"},{"content":"Database Management System A database management system (DBMS) can store, edit and organise all the data in a database.\n It stores data in one central location. It controls who can access and edit the data. It allows data to be shared by many users. It provides user interfaces to work with the data. It automatically creates backups of the data.  DBMS offers many significant benefits.\n Security: the data is in a safe central location and different access rights can be given to different people. Efficiency: it avoids data duplication and inconsistency within the data collection; also less storage space is taken up because data is shared. Customisation: applications to access data can be customised to suit the needs of individual users.  An important feature of a DBMS is separating applications from the data. When people use the applications they call on the data they need to work on. They do not need to use all the data every time they use the database. The structure of the database can change but the applications using the data do not need to be changed. A database in a DBMS can be viewed by lots of different people with different responsibilities. For example, within a company there are different departments, as well as customers, who each need to see different kinds of data. Each employee in the company will have different levels of access to the database through their own customised application.\n\r ","description":"","id":1,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"DBMS","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/databases/dbms/"},{"content":"What is artificial intelligence?

His idea of creating a machine to turn thought processes into numbers was a turning\npoint in the history of computers.\nTuring, born in London in 1912, developed some of his most significant theories while studying mathematics at Cambridge in the 1930s. However, despite his brilliance, he suffered from a feeling of isolation, and found it difficult to make friends.\nAfter graduating, Turing went to Princeton in the US, where he began work on what was later to become the first digital computer program: the Turing Machine\u0026quot;. His revolutionary idea was for a machine that would read a series of 1s and 0s and Os from a tape describing the steps needed to solve a problem or task. It was only years later that technology had advanced sufficiently to transfer these ideas into real machines.\nBack in England, Turing helped the Allies win World War Il by decoding encrypted German communications. The German Enigma machine generated a constantly changing code to make it impossible to decipher.\nBut Turing\u0026rsquo; s creation of Colossus - the first fully electronic digital computer - managed to crack the Enigma\u0026rsquo;s codes and reveal secret Nazi war plans. The story is told in the film The Imitation Game.After the war, Turing continued research into digital computers. In 1946 he developed the Automatic Computing Engine, a revolutionary electronic computer with a high-speed memory and stored programs. In 1950 he wrote an article entitled \u0026lsquo;Comptiting machinery and intelligence\u0026rsquo;, which was one of the first to deal with the concept of artificial intelligence. He believed an intelligent machine could be created by following the model of the human brain. He compared devices such as cameras and microphones to parts of the human body and his views often landed him in controversy with other scientists.\nHis \u0026lsquo;Turing Test\u0026rsquo; has become a standard measure of artificial intelligence. In the test an interrogator asks questions via keyboard to a human being and to an intelligent machine, both unseen. If the interrogator is unable to distinguish the human from the machine, based on their answers, then the machine can be described as \u0026rsquo;thinking\u0026rsquo;.\nTuring refused to conform to accepted ideas. Always an outsider, he also felt marginalised because of his homosexuality.He died mysteroiusly of poisoning, possibly suicide, in June 1954, but he left the world a permanent legacy.\n\n","description":"","id":4,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Life","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/turing/life/"},{"content":"Will Robots take our jobs? \r What is unpredictable about recent technological changes?

Databases have become essential in many different areas of modern life from government and business to science and education. Tax authorities, for example, use databases to keep records of taxpayers and payments, businesses use them to keep customer account and schools use them to maintain student records.\nA simple flat-file database is like a table with vertical columns, called \u0026lsquo;fields\u0026rsquo;, and horizontal rows, called \u0026lsquo;records\u0026rsquo;. The records refer to the people or things with which the database is concerned (students, customers, products, etc.) and the fields contain various categories of information about them.\nFields can consist of different types of data:\nText: for example names or brief descriptions (codes, such as M/F for male/female, are often used to save space).\nDates or times: which must follow a standardised format (e.g, 18/09/02). Numberst which may be integers (whole numbers: 6) or decimal numbers (6, 5).\nCalculated numbers: which are automatically worked out using a formula (e.g, a person\u0026rsquo;s age based on their date of birth + today\u0026rsquo;s date)\nGraphics: which may be a photograph or any other type of image.\nA flat-file database enables a user to view data from only one file at a time. A relational database is a more complex system in which data from many different files are interlinked. In this case a database management system (DBMS) is necessaryto organise and analyse all this data.\nA programming language, called \u0026ldquo;Structured Query Language\u0026rdquo; (SQL), enables users to define the sort of data they are looking for. For example, a shopping website uses SQL to translate a customer\u0026rsquo;s input into a request for the DBMS. The DBMS then instructs the computer to retrieve the data that match the definition requested.\n\r ","description":"","id":6,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"The Databases","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/databases/the-databases/"},{"content":"The Spreadsheet A spreadsheet is a program that can process and display data, both numbers and text, in different ways. It is used in an enormous variety of fields, from financial figure and climate statistics to population data and examination results. Its main functions are to:\n Record data so that it can be easily searched. Perform calculations based on the stored data. Rroduce graphs and charts based on the stored data.  A spreadsheet looks like a large table made up of vertical columns (A. B. C, etc.) and horizontal roms (1, 2, 3, etc.). The columns and pows divide the table irito individual cells. Each cell can be identified by its coordinates: the column letter and row number (e. g. B2, D4).\nBy clicking on a cell, you can type into it one of three things.\n Text data. This is normally to give a title identifying each column and row in the table. Numerical data. These are the numbers that the spreadsheet has to analyse (representing amounts of money, temperature, exam scores, etc.). A formula. This tells the spreadsheet what to do with the numbers (e g. add all the numbers from B2 to E2 or from B2 to 85) and insert the result in the\ncell. The formula is usually typed into the last cell of a column or a row (e g. F2 or B6 in the example above). The formula itself is not visible on the spreadsheet, only the result. The simplest formulas are for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but most spreadsheet programs offer many other options, such as calculeting an average or a percentage.  The cells are interlinked so that changing the number in one cell will automatically change the results of all the calculations connected to it. This means that a spreadsheet can be instantly updated and it also allows the user to see immediately what would happen in various hypothetical situations (e.g if a tax were increased by 1%,how much more money would the government collect). One spreadsheet can be linked to another one or to a large database, allowing even more complex exchanges of data and calculations.\n\r ","description":"","id":7,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"The Spreadsheet","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/databases/the-spreadsheet/"},{"content":"\nThe Turing test: Can a computer pass for a human? \r How does the Turing test work?
