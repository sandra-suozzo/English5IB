[{"content":"Alpha GO A computer program called AlphaGo has beaten Lee Sedol, a master player In the ancient Chinese board game of Go in a landmark moment for AI.\nIn Go two player take turns in placing black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. To win you need to surround your opponent\u0026rsquo;s pieces. It is a more complex challenge for a computer than chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe - and players rely on human instinct as much as strategy. Most experts had considered defeating a Go champion beyond the present capacity of artificial intelligence.\nWhen IBM\u0026rsquo;s Deep Blue supercomputer beat world chess champion Gerry Kasparov in 1907, the victory was not due to human-like intelligence: it won by the brute force of its processing power, searching through millions of moves in seconds.However, the complexity of Go requires a completely different approach.Processing power is not enough to beat a Go champion of the calibre of Lee Sedol.\nAlphaGo, developed by a company called DeepMind, was designed to adopt an intuitive, human-like style of gameplay. It followed a technique called \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo;, which imitates the workings of the human brain to allow a program to develop by teaching itself through trial and error. Rather than programming rules and strategies, DeepMind designer taught AlphaGo to play the game by feeding it data based on typical Go moves. Then AlphaGo played against itself, millions of times, learning from its mistakes and getting better each time. Deep learning changes the relationship humans have with their technological creations, It results in Al that displays surprising and unpredictable behaviour Lee Sedol described being stunned by one unconventional move from AlphaGo which no human would ever have made. In traditional computer programming the aim is to anticipate all possible eventualities and a surprise means that something needs to be fixed. With deep learning, unpredictability and surprises may indicate that the program has found a better way of doing something than its human creators had ever imagined. In the coming years, AlphaGo will continue to learn and to improve, surprising and teaching humans new moves and strategies.\nOther Al programs, also based on deep leaming and unpredictability, could be designed to overtake human abilities in highly complex tasks: diagnosing illness, managing power grids, protecting against cyber threat. All of this has enormous implications for the future development of Al and our ability to control it.\nWhy s GO described as the \u0026lsquo;Holy Grail\u0026rsquo; (Santo Graal) of computer games? \r ","description":"","id":0,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Alpha Go","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/artificial-intelligence/alpha-go/"},{"content":"Computer Hacking It is a practice of modifying computer hardware and software to accomplish a goal outside the creator’s original purpose. The purpose of hacking a computer system may vary from simply demonstrations of the technical ability, to stealing, modifying or destroying information for social, economic or political reasons. Now corporations are hiring hackers, people who are engaged in hacking computers with the purpose to hack the computer of an organization and to find and fix security vulnerabilities. The hackers may be classified as:\nWhite Hat White Hat hackers are the people who hack the system to find the security vulnerabilities of it and notify the organizations so that a preventive action can be taken to protect the system from outside hackers. White hat hackers may be paid as employee of an organization to find the security loopholes or to be a freelancer who just wants to prove his mantle in this field. They are popular known as ethical hackers.\nBlack Hat In contrast to the white hat, the black hat hacks the system with ill intentions. They may hack the system for social, political, or economically motivated intentions. They find the security loopholes in the system and keep the information themselves and exploit the system for personal or organizational benefits till organization whose system is compromised is aware of this and apply security patches. They are popularly known as crackers.\nGrey Hat Grey hat hackers find out the security vulnerabilities, report to the site administrators, and offer the fix of the security bug for a consultancy fee.\nBlue Hat A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who tests a system prior to its launch, looking for bugs so they can be fixed.\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Computer Hacking","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/cybersecurity/computer-hacking/"},{"content":"Database Management System A database management system (DBMS) can store, edit and organise all the data in a database.\n It stores data in one central location. It controls who can access and edit the data. It allows data to be shared by many users. It provides user interfaces to work with the data. It automatically creates backups of the data.  DBMS offers many significant benefits.\n Security: the data is in a safe central location and different access rights can be given to different people. Efficiency: it avoids data duplication and inconsistency within the data collection; also less storage space is taken up because data is shared. Customisation: applications to access data can be customised to suit the needs of individual users.  An important feature of a DBMS is separating applications from the data. When people use the applications they call on the data they need to work on. They do not need to use all the data every time they use the database. The structure of the database can change but the applications using the data do not need to be changed. A database in a DBMS can be viewed by lots of different people with different responsibilities. For example, within a company there are different departments, as well as customers, who each need to see different kinds of data. Each employee in the company will have different levels of access to the database through their own customised application.\n\r ","description":"","id":2,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"DBMS","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/databases/dbms/"},{"content":"What is artificial intelligence?

His idea of creating a machine to turn thought processes into numbers was a turning\npoint in the history of computers.\nTuring, born in London in 1912, developed some of his most significant theories while studying mathematics at Cambridge in the 1930s. However, despite his brilliance, he suffered from a feeling of isolation, and found it difficult to make friends.\nAfter graduating, Turing went to Princeton in the US, where he began work on what was later to become the first digital computer program: the Turing Machine\u0026quot;. His revolutionary idea was for a machine that would read a series of 1s and 0s and Os from a tape describing the steps needed to solve a problem or task. It was only years later that technology had advanced sufficiently to transfer these ideas into real machines.\nBack in England, Turing helped the Allies win World War Il by decoding encrypted German communications. The German Enigma machine generated a constantly changing code to make it impossible to decipher.\nBut Turing\u0026rsquo; s creation of Colossus - the first fully electronic digital computer - managed to crack the Enigma\u0026rsquo;s codes and reveal secret Nazi war plans. The story is told in the film The Imitation Game.After the war, Turing continued research into digital computers. In 1946 he developed the Automatic Computing Engine, a revolutionary electronic computer with a high-speed memory and stored programs. In 1950 he wrote an article entitled \u0026lsquo;Comptiting machinery and intelligence\u0026rsquo;, which was one of the first to deal with the concept of artificial intelligence. He believed an intelligent machine could be created by following the model of the human brain. He compared devices such as cameras and microphones to parts of the human body and his views often landed him in controversy with other scientists.\nHis \u0026lsquo;Turing Test\u0026rsquo; has become a standard measure of artificial intelligence. In the test an interrogator asks questions via keyboard to a human being and to an intelligent machine, both unseen. If the interrogator is unable to distinguish the human from the machine, based on their answers, then the machine can be described as \u0026rsquo;thinking\u0026rsquo;.\nTuring refused to conform to accepted ideas. Always an outsider, he also felt marginalised because of his homosexuality.He died mysteroiusly of poisoning, possibly suicide, in June 1954, but he left the world a permanent legacy.\n\n","description":"","id":5,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Life","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/turing/life/"},{"content":"Malware and its type Malware stands for “Malicious Software” and it is designed to gain access or installed into the computer without the consent of the user. They perform unwanted tasks in the host computer for the benefit of a third party. There is a full range of malwares which can seriously degrade the performance of the host machine. Some of these go from simply distracting/annoying the user, to more complex or harmful actions which capture sensitive data from the host machine and send it to remote servers. There are various types of malware present on the Internet. Some of the popular ones are:\nAdware It is a special type of malware which is used to perform unwanted advertising. They either redirect the page to some advertising page or pop-up an additional page which promotes some products or events. This adware is financially supported by organizations whose products are advertised.\nSpyware It is a special type of which is installed in the target computer with or without the user permission. It is designed to steal sensitive information from the target machine. Mostly it gathers the browsing habits of the user and then sends it to the remote server without the owner of the computer knowing it. Most of the time it is downloaded onto the host computer while downloading free application programmes from the internet. Spyware may be of various types: It can keep track of the cookies of the host computer, it can act as a keylogger to sniff the banking passwords and sensitive information, etc.\nBrowser hijacking software It downloads some malicious software which is offered over the internet and installed in the host computer without the permission of the user who is not aware/doesn’t know it. This software modifies the browser’s setting and redirect links to malicious sites.\nVirus A virus is a malicious code written to damage/harm the host computer by deleting or appending a file, occupy memory space of the computer by replicating the copy of the code, slowing down the performance of the computer, formatting the host machine, etc. It can be spread via email attachment, pen drives, digital images, e-greeting, audio or video clips, etc. A virus may be present in a computer but it cannot activate itself without the human intervention. Until and unless the executable file(.exe) is executed, a virus cannot be activated in the host machine.\n","description":"","id":6,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Malware and its type","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/cybersecurity/malware-and-its-type/"},{"content":"Will Robots take our jobs? \r What is unpredictable about recent technological changes?

There are two basic types: system software and application software, System software is a permanent component of the computer that controls essential functions and provides a platform for application software. Application software is user-oriented: it enables users to perform specific tasks such as editing a document or browsing the web. It relies on, and runs within, the environment provided by the system software.\nThe operating System A computer\u0026rsquo;s operating system (OS) is the system software which manages the computer\u0026rsquo; resources and allows all the various hardware and software components to work together. Popular examples include \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Windows\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;macOS\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo;. The OS controls the computer by performing basic essential tasks such as receiving data from the keyboard, displaying information on the screen or storing it in the memory. It works the whole time that the computer is switched on, and parts of it can be permanently stored in a computer\u0026rsquo;s ROM. The OS allows the different application programs to run and make use of the computer\u0026rsquo; resources. Most applications are written to work with a particular OS. An advanced OS allows multiprocessing, in which several programs can run at the same time. A multiuser OS allows several different people to use the computer at the same time, usually connected through a network. The OS stores data in collections called \u0026lsquo;files\u0026rsquo;. The file system of an OS allows programs to give names to files, and it keeps track of each file\u0026rsquo;s location. The files can also be grouped together, for more convenience, into directories or folders.\nOther elements of the operating system The OS controls a range of utilities, special programs designed to carry out specific maintenance tasks to keep the computer operating smoothly: for example, tidying up the hard drive or checking files for viruses. Drivers are OS programs linked to particular peripheral devices such as a printer or a mouse. The driver integrates the device into the computer system so that it can work with all the other elements. Modern operating systems provide a graphical user interfare (GUI) to make programs easier to use. Earlier systems required the user to type in written instructions to make the computer work. A GUI allows the user to control the computer, with the help of a mouse or touchpad, simply by moving, and clicking on, images or words on the screen.\n","description":"","id":8,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"System Software","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/programming-lenguages/system-software/"},{"content":"The Databases A database is a way of storing large quantities of information so that, using a computer, it can be\n searched: to find specific data. sorted (i.e, organised in different ways): to compare data and create reports.  Databases have become essential in many different areas of modern life from government and business to science and education. Tax authorities, for example, use databases to keep records of taxpayers and payments, businesses use them to keep customer account and schools use them to maintain student records.\nA simple flat-file database is like a table with vertical columns, called \u0026lsquo;fields\u0026rsquo;, and horizontal rows, called \u0026lsquo;records\u0026rsquo;. The records refer to the people or things with which the database is concerned (students, customers, products, etc.) and the fields contain various categories of information about them.\nFields can consist of different types of data:\nText: for example names or brief descriptions (codes, such as M/F for male/female, are often used to save space).\nDates or times: which must follow a standardised format (e.g, 18/09/02). Numberst which may be integers (whole numbers: 6) or decimal numbers (6, 5).\nCalculated numbers: which are automatically worked out using a formula (e.g, a person\u0026rsquo;s age based on their date of birth + today\u0026rsquo;s date)\nGraphics: which may be a photograph or any other type of image.\nA flat-file database enables a user to view data from only one file at a time. A relational database is a more complex system in which data from many different files are interlinked. In this case a database management system (DBMS) is necessaryto organise and analyse all this data.\nA programming language, called \u0026ldquo;Structured Query Language\u0026rdquo; (SQL), enables users to define the sort of data they are looking for. For example, a shopping website uses SQL to translate a customer\u0026rsquo;s input into a request for the DBMS. The DBMS then instructs the computer to retrieve the data that match the definition requested.\n\r ","description":"","id":9,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"The Databases","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/databases/the-databases/"},{"content":"The Spreadsheet A spreadsheet is a program that can process and display data, both numbers and text, in different ways. It is used in an enormous variety of fields, from financial figure and climate statistics to population data and examination results. Its main functions are to:\n Record data so that it can be easily searched. Perform calculations based on the stored data. Rroduce graphs and charts based on the stored data.  A spreadsheet looks like a large table made up of vertical columns (A. B. C, etc.) and horizontal roms (1, 2, 3, etc.). The columns and pows divide the table irito individual cells. Each cell can be identified by its coordinates: the column letter and row number (e. g. B2, D4).\nBy clicking on a cell, you can type into it one of three things.\n Text data. This is normally to give a title identifying each column and row in the table. Numerical data. These are the numbers that the spreadsheet has to analyse (representing amounts of money, temperature, exam scores, etc.). A formula. This tells the spreadsheet what to do with the numbers (e g. add all the numbers from B2 to E2 or from B2 to 85) and insert the result in the\ncell. The formula is usually typed into the last cell of a column or a row (e g. F2 or B6 in the example above). The formula itself is not visible on the spreadsheet, only the result. The simplest formulas are for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but most spreadsheet programs offer many other options, such as calculeting an average or a percentage.  The cells are interlinked so that changing the number in one cell will automatically change the results of all the calculations connected to it. This means that a spreadsheet can be instantly updated and it also allows the user to see immediately what would happen in various hypothetical situations (e.g if a tax were increased by 1%,how much more money would the government collect).

The loss includes the cost of repairing the system, cost associated with the loss of business during downtime and cost of loss of opportunity. If the organization finds the hacker, it can sue him for the sum of more than or equivalent to the loss borne by the organization.\nSpamming Sending of unsolicited and commercial bulk message over the internet is known as spamming. An email can be classified as spam, if it follows these three criteria:\n Mass mailing: - the email is not targeted to one particular person but to a large number of peoples. Anonymity: - The real identify of the person not known Unsolicited: - the email is neither expected nor requested for the recipient. These spams not only irritate the recipients and overload the network but also waste the time and occupy the valuable memory space of the mailbox.  Cross Site Scripting It is an activity which involves injecting a malicious client-side script into a trusted website. As soon as the browser executes the malicious script, it gets access to the cookies and other sensitive information and sent them to remote servers. Now this information can be used to gain financial benefit or physical access to a system for personal interest.\nOnline Auction Fraud There are many genuine websites who offers online auctions over internet. Taking the advantage of the reputation of these websites, some of the cyber criminals lure the customers to online auction fraud schemes which often lead to either overpayment of the product or the item is never delivered once the payment is made.\nCyber Squatting It is an act of reserving the domain names of someone else’s trademark with intent to sell it afterwards to the organization who is the owner of the trademark at a higher price.\nLogic Bombs These are malicious code inserted into legitimate software. The malicious action is triggered by some specific condition. If the conditions holds true in future, the malicious action begins and based on the action defined in the malicious code, they either destroy the information stored in the system or make system unusable.\nWeb Jacking / Defacement The hacker gain access to a website of an organization and either blocks it or modifies it to serve political, economical or social interest. The recent examples of web jacking are some of the websites of the educational institutes were hacked by Pakistani hackers and an animation which contains Pakistani flags were flashed in the homepage of these websites. Another example is Indian hackers who hacked the website of Pakistani railways and flashed Indian flag in the homepage for several hours on the occasion of Independence Day of India in 2014.\nInternet Time Thefts Hacking the username and password of ISP of an individual and surfing the internet at his cost is Internet Time Theft.\nDenial of Service Attack It is a cyber attack in which the network is chocked and often collapsed by flooding it with useless traffic and thus preventing the legitimate network traffic.\nSalami Attack It is an attack which proceeds with small increments and final add up to lead to a major attack. The increments are so small that they remain unnoticed. An example of salami attack is gaining access to online banking of an individual and withdrawing amount in such a small amounts that it remains unnoticed by the owner. Often there is default trigger set in the banking website and transactions below say, Rs. 1000 withdrawal are not reported to the owner of the account. Withdrawing amount of Rs. 1000 over a period of time will lead to total withdrawal of a large sum.\nData Diddling Data Diddling It is a practice of changing data before its entry into the computer system. Often, the original data is retained after the execution on the data is done. For example, DA or the basic salary of the person is changed in the payroll data of an individual for pay calculation. Once the salary is calculated and transferred to his account, the total salary is replaced by his actual salary in the report. Data Diddling is unauthorised altering of data before or during entry into a computer system, and then changing it back after processing is done. Using this technique, the attacker may modify the expected output and is difficult to track. In other words, the original information to be entered is changed, either by a person typing in the data, a virus that’s programmed to change the data, the programmer of the database or application, or anyone else involved in the process of creating, recording, encoding, examining, checking, converting or transmitting data.\nThis is one of the simplest methods of committing a computer-related crime, because even a computer amateur can do it. Despite this being an effortless task, it can have detrimental effects. For example, a person responsible for accounting may change data about themselves or a friend or relative showing that they’re paid in full. By altering or failing to enter the information, they’re able to steal from the enterprise. Other examples include forging or counterfeiting documents and exchanging valid computer tapes or cards with prepared replacements. Electricity boards in India have been victims of data diddling by computer criminals when private parties were computerizing their systems.\nEmail Spoofing It is a process of changing the header information of an e-mail so that its original source is not identified and it appears to an individual at the receiving end that the email has been originated from source other than the original source.\n","description":"","id":12,"section":"en","tags":null,"title":"Viruses over internet","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/ko/en/docs/cybersecurity/viruses-over-internet/"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s a Cyber Crime Introduction to cyber crime The internet was born around 1960‟s where its access was limited to a few scientists, researchers and the Defense only. Initially computer criminals’ purpose was only meant to damage computers and related infrastructure. Around 1980‟s the trend changed from damaging the machine to causing a computer malfunction using a malicious code called virus. Till then the effect was not so widespread because Internet was only confined to defense setups, large international companies and research communities. In 1996, when internet was launched for the public, it immediately became popular, and masses slowly became dependent on it to an extent that has changed their lifestyle. The GUIs were so well designed that users were able to surf easily by simply clicking hyper links or typing in the URL bar the desired information. Internet users didn’t bother to know where data was stored, how it was sent over the internet or whether the data could be accessed by another person connected to the internet. There was no concern about the possibility that data packets sent over the internet might have been “spoofed” and “tampered”. The focus of the computer crime shifted from merely damaging the computer or destroying or manipulating data for personal benefit to financial crime. These computer attacks have increased at a rapid pace.\nBefore discussing the matter further, let us know what cybercrime is? The term cybercrime is used to describe an unlawful activity in which computer or computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. are used as a tool or/and target of criminal activity.\nClassification of Cyber Crimes Cybercriminals could be internal or external to the organization facing cyber-attacks. Based on this fact, cybercrime could be categorized into two types:\n- Insider Attack: An attack to the network or the computer system by someone with authorized system access is known as insider attack. It is generally performed by dissatisfied or unhappy employees or contractors. The reason of this kind of attack could be revenge or greed. It is pretty easy for an insider to perform a cyber-attack as he is well aware of the policies and IT architecture of the security system. Moreover, the attacker has access to the network. Therefore, it is easy for a insider attacker to steal sensitive information, cause the network to crash, etc. In most of cases an insider attack is performed by someone (an employee) who has been fired or assigned a new role which does not comply with IT policies.\n- External Attack: When the attacker is either hired by an insider or an external entity to the organization, it is known as external attack. The organization which is a victim of cyber-attacks not only faces financial loss but also the loss of reputation. These attackers usually scan and gather information so an experienced network/security administrator who keeps an eye on the log generated by the firewalls is highly recommended as external attacks can be traced out by carefully analyzing these firewall logs. Also, Intrusion Detection Systems may be installed to spot external attacks.\nUNSTRUCTURED AND STRUCTURED ATTACKS\n- Unstructured Attack: These attacks are generally performed by amateurs with no particular reasons to perform a cyber-attack but to test a tool available over the internet.\n- Structure Attack: These types of attacks are performed by highly skilled, experienced, and motivated criminals. They have access to sophisticated tools and technologies to gain access to other etworks without being noticed by their Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Moreover, these attackers have the necessary expertise to develop or modify the existing tools to satisfy their purpose. These types of attacks are usually performed by professional criminals, by a country against a rival country, or by politicians with the purpose of damaging someone’s image, terrorists, etc. Cybercrimes have turned out to be a low-investment, low-risk business with huge returns. Nowadays these crimes are performed by highly organized people. They are targeting large financial organizations and they are also into online drugs trading. An hacker who has hacked sensitive data from an organization may use it for financially exploiting the organization himself. In case, the hacker himself has the technical expertise to perform it, he will do it himself, otherwise he may find someone interested in buying that data. Cyber criminals can be hired by other organizations which want to gain access to some sensitive data, or perform massive denial-of –service attacks against their competitors. An organization affected by a cyber-attack, not only faces financial loss, but its reputation is also adversely affected while its competitor will definitely benefit from it.\nReasons for Commission of Cyber Crimes  Money: Criminals can make money quickly and easily. Revenge: Taking revenge on other people/organizations/companies/ by defaming its reputation or bringing economical loss. This comes under the category of cyber terrorism. Fun: Amateurs commit cybercrimes for fun. They just want to test the latest tools. Recognition: It deals with pride. Hacking highly secured networks (Defense) or sites is considered a credit. Anonymity: Cyber space offers anonymity that motivates criminals to commit cybercrimes as it is much easier to perform a crime over the cyber space and remain anonymous. It’s a lot more dangerous in the real world. It is also easier to get away with criminal activities in a “cyber world” than in the real world. This strong sense of anonymity may push respectable citizens to abandon their ethics in the pursuit of personal gain. Cyber Espionage: Governments may be involved in cyber trespassing for political or economic, reasons.
