[{"content":"Alpha GO A computer program called AlphaGo has beaten Lee Sedol, a master player In the ancient Chinese board game of Go in a landmark moment for AI.\nIn Go two player take turns in placing black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. To win you need to surround your opponent\u0026rsquo;s pieces. It is a more complex challenge for a computer than chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe - and players rely on human instinct as much as strategy. Most experts had considered defeating a Go champion beyond the present capacity of artificial intelligence.\nWhen IBM\u0026rsquo;s Deep Blue supercomputer beat world chess champion Gerry Kasparov in 1907, the victory was not due to human-like intelligence: it won by the brute force of its processing power, searching through millions of moves in seconds.However, the complexity of Go requires a completely different approach.Processing power is not enough to beat a Go champion of the calibre of Lee Sedol.\nAlphaGo, developed by a company called DeepMind, was designed to adopt an intuitive, human-like style of gameplay. It followed a technique called \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo;, which imitates the workings of the human brain to allow a program to develop by teaching itself through trial and error. Rather than programming rules and strategies, DeepMind designer taught AlphaGo to play the game by feeding it data based on typical Go moves. Then AlphaGo played against itself, millions of times, learning from its mistakes and getting better each time. Deep learning changes the relationship humans have with their technological creations, It results in Al that displays surprising and unpredictable behaviour Lee Sedol described being stunned by one unconventional move from AlphaGo which no human would ever have made. In traditional computer programming the aim is to anticipate all possible eventualities and a surprise means that something needs to be fixed. With deep learning, unpredictability and surprises may indicate that the program has found a better way of doing something than its human creators had ever imagined. In the coming years, AlphaGo will continue to learn and to improve, surprising and teaching humans new moves and strategies.\nOther Al programs, also based on deep leaming and unpredictability, could be designed to overtake human abilities in highly complex tasks: diagnosing illness, managing power grids, protecting against cyber threat. All of this has enormous implications for the future development of Al and our ability to control it.\nWhy s GO described as the \u0026lsquo;Holy Grail\u0026rsquo; (Santo Graal) of computer games? \r ","description":"","id":0,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Alpha GO","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/docs/artificial-intelligence/alpha-go/"},{"content":"What is artificial intelligence? Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. This means creating algorithms to classify, analyze, and draw predictions from data. It also involves acting on data, learning from new data, and improving over time.\n\r \u0026ldquo;Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.

The stores are cashierless, thus partially automated, with customers able to purchase products without being checked out by a cashier or using a self-checkout station.Amazon uses several technologies to automate Go stores, including computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion for the purchase, checkout, and payment steps associated with a retail transaction.The store concept is seen as a revolutionary model that relies on the prevalence of smartphones and geofencing technology to streamline the customer experience, as well as supply chain and inventory management.\n\r OpenAI Plays Hide and Seek \r Artificial Intelligence and Social Media Artificial intelligence can dramatically increase the revenues you bring in from social, while reducing the costs of social media strategy, creation, and management.\nAI-powered tools are being deployed today by brands to:\n Create social media posts and optimize social media campaigns.

His idea of creating a machine to turn thought processes into numbers was a turning\npoint in the history of computers.\nTuring, born in London in 1912, developed some of his most significant theories while studying mathematics at Cambridge in the 1930s. However, despite his brilliance, he suffered from a feeling of isolation, and found it difficult to make friends.\nAfter graduating, Turing went to Princeton in the US, where he began work on what was later to become the first digital computer program: the Turing Machine\u0026quot;. His revolutionary idea was for a machine that would read a series of 1s and 0s and Os from a tape describing the steps needed to solve a problem or task. It was only years later that technology had advanced sufficiently to transfer these ideas into real machines.\nBack in England, Turing helped the Allies win World War Il by decoding encrypted German communications. The German Enigma machine generated a constantly changing code to make it impossible to decipher.\nBut Turing\u0026rsquo; s creation of Colossus - the first fully electronic digital computer - managed to crack the Enigma\u0026rsquo;s codes and reveal secret Nazi war plans. The story is told in the film The Imitation Game.After the war, Turing continued research into digital computers. In 1946 he developed the Automatic Computing Engine, a revolutionary electronic computer with a high-speed memory and stored programs. In 1950 he wrote an article entitled \u0026lsquo;Comptiting machinery and intelligence\u0026rsquo;, which was one of the first to deal with the concept of artificial intelligence. He believed an intelligent machine could be created by following the model of the human brain. He compared devices such as cameras and microphones to parts of the human body and his views often landed him in controversy with other scientists.\nHis \u0026lsquo;Turing Test\u0026rsquo; has become a standard measure of artificial intelligence. In the test an interrogator asks questions via keyboard to a human being and to an intelligent machine, both unseen. If the interrogator is unable to distinguish the human from the machine, based on their answers, then the machine can be described as \u0026rsquo;thinking\u0026rsquo;.\nTuring refused to conform to accepted ideas. Always an outsider, he also felt marginalised because of his homosexuality.He died mysteroiusly of poisoning, possibly suicide, in June 1954, but he left the world a permanent legacy.\n\n","description":"","id":3,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Life","uri":"https://sandra-suozzo.github.io/English5IB/docs/turing/life/"},{"content":"Will Robots take our jobs? \r What is unpredictable about recent technological changes?
