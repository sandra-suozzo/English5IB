[{"content":"What is artificial intelligence? Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. This means creating algorithms to classify, analyze, and draw predictions from data. It also involves acting on data, learning from new data, and improving over time.\n \u0026ldquo;Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.‚Äù AI is a machine with the ability to solve problems that usually are done by humans using intelligence\u0026rdquo;\nThe Original 7 Aspects of A.I (1955) 1 Simulating higher functions of the human brain.\n2 Programming a computer to use general language.\n3 Arranging hy pothetical neurons in a manner so that they can form concepts.\n4 Awav to determine and measure problem complexity,\n5 Sell-improvement.\n6 Abstraction: Defined as the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.\n7 Randomness and creativity.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Definition","uri":"http://example.org/docs/artificial-intelligence/definition/"},{"content":"Some examples Amazon GO Amazon Go is a chain of convenience stores in the United States and the United Kingdom, operated by the online retailer Amazon. The stores are cashierless, thus partially automated, with customers able to purchase products without being checked out by a cashier or using a self-checkout station.Amazon uses several technologies to automate Go stores, including computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion for the purchase, checkout, and payment steps associated with a retail transaction.The store concept is seen as a revolutionary model that relies on the prevalence of smartphones and geofencing technology to streamline the customer experience, as well as supply chain and inventory management.\n OpenAI Plays Hide and Seek  Artificial Intelligence and Social Media Artificial intelligence can dramatically increase the revenues you bring in from social, while reducing the costs of social media strategy, creation, and management.\nAI-powered tools are being deployed today by brands to:\n Create social media posts and optimize social media campaigns. Figure out what posts work best using advanced analytics. Measure brand and trends across each social media channel and find your target audience. Write social ads. Decrease social media management time and costs across platforms. Conduct social media monitoring.

His idea of creating a machine to turn thought processes into numbers was a turning\npoint in the history of computers.\nTuring, born in London in 1912, developed some of his most significant theories while studying mathematics at Cambridge in the 1930s. However, despite his brilliance, he suffered from a feeling of isolation, and found it difficult to make friends.\nAfter graduating, Turing went to Princeton in the US, where he began work on what was later to become the first digital computer program: the Turing Machine\u0026quot;. His revolutionary idea was for a machine that would read a series of 1s and 0s and Os from a tape describing the steps needed to solve a problem or task. It was only years later that technology had advanced sufficiently to transfer these ideas into real machines.\nBack in England, Turing helped the Allies win World War Il by decoding encrypted German communications. The German Enigma machine generated a constantly changing code to make it impossible to decipher.\nBut Turing' s creation of Colossus - the first fully electronic digital computer - managed to crack the Enigma\u0026rsquo;s codes and reveal secret Nazi war plans. The story is told in the film The Imitation Game.After the war, Turing continued research into digital computers. In 1946 he developed the Automatic Computing Engine, a revolutionary electronic computer with a high-speed memory and stored programs. In 1950 he wrote an article entitled \u0026lsquo;Comptiting machinery and intelligence\u0026rsquo;, which was one of the first to deal with the concept of artificial intelligence. He believed an intelligent machine could be created by following the model of the human brain. He compared devices such as cameras and microphones to parts of the human body and his views often landed him in controversy with other scientists.\nHis \u0026lsquo;Turing Test\u0026rsquo; has become a standard measure of artificial intelligence. In the test an interrogator asks questions via keyboard to a human being and to an intelligent machine, both unseen. If the interrogator is unable to distinguish the human from the machine, based on their answers, then the machine can be described as \u0026lsquo;thinking\u0026rsquo;.\nTuring refused to conform to accepted ideas. Always an outsider, he also felt marginalised because of his homosexuality.He died mysteroiusly of poisoning, possibly suicide, in June 1954, but he left the world a permanent legacy.\n\n","description":"","id":2,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Life","uri":"http://example.org/docs/turing/life/"},{"content":"\nThe Turing test: Can a computer pass for a human?
