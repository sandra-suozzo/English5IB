## Malware and its type

Malware stands for “Malicious Software” and it is designed to gain access or installed into the computer without the consent of the user. They perform unwanted tasks in the host computer for the benefit of a third party. There is a full range of malwares which can seriously degrade the performance of the host machine. Some of these go from simply distracting/annoying the user, to more complex or harmful actions which capture sensitive data from the host machine and send it to remote servers. There are various types of malware present on the Internet. Some of the popular ones are:

### Adware
It is a special type of malware which is used to perform unwanted advertising. They either redirect the page to some advertising page or pop-up an additional page which promotes some products or events. This adware is financially supported by organizations whose products are advertised. 

### Spyware
It is a special type of which is installed in the target computer with or without the user permission. It is designed to steal sensitive information from the target machine. Mostly it gathers the browsing habits of the user and then sends it to the remote server without the owner of the computer knowing it. Most of the time it is downloaded onto the host computer while downloading free application programmes from the internet. Spyware may be of various types: It can keep track of the cookies of the host computer, it can act as a keylogger to sniff the banking passwords and sensitive information, etc. 

### Browser hijacking software
It downloads some malicious software which is offered over the internet and installed in the host computer without the permission of the user who is not aware/doesn’t know it. This software modifies the browser’s setting and redirect links to malicious sites. 

### Virus
A virus is a malicious code written to damage/harm the host computer by deleting or appending a file, occupy memory space of the computer by replicating the copy of the code, slowing down the performance of the computer, formatting the host machine, etc. It can be spread via email attachment, pen drives, digital images, e-greeting, audio or video clips, etc. A virus may be present in a computer but it cannot activate itself without the human intervention.  Until and unless the executable file(.exe) is executed, a virus cannot be activated in the host machine.

## Computer Hacking
It is a practice of modifying computer hardware and software to accomplish a goal outside the creator’s original purpose. The purpose of hacking a computer system may vary from simply demonstrations of the technical ability, to sealing, modifying or destroying information for social, economic or political reasons. Now corporations are hiring hackers, people who are engaged in hacking computers with the purpose to hack the computer of an organization and to find and fix security vulnerabilities. The hackers may be classified as:

### White Hat
White Hat hackers are the people who hack the system to find the security vulnerabilities of it and notify the organizations so that a preventive action can be taken to protect the system from outside hackers. White hat hackers may be paid as employee of an organization to find the security loopholes or to be a freelancer who just wants to prove his mantle in this field. They are popular known as ethical hackers. 

### Black Hat
In contrast to the white hat, the black hat hacks the system with ill intentions. They may hack the system for social, political, or economically motivated intentions. They find the security loopholes in the system and keep the information themselves and exploit the system for personal or organizational benefits till organization whose system is compromised is aware of this and apply security patches. They are popularly known as crackers.

### Grey Hat
Grey hat hackers find out the security vulnerabilities, report to the site administrators, and offer the fix of the security bug for a consultancy fee. 

### Blue Hat
A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who tests a system prior to its launch, looking for bugs so they can be fixed.

## Creating and distributing viruses over internet
Spreading of a virus can cause business and financial loss to an organization. The loss includes the cost of repairing the system, cost associated with the loss of business during downtime and cost of loss of opportunity. If the organization finds the hacker, it can sue him for the sum of more than or equivalent to the loss borne by the organization.
