## Programming Languages most in demand
Many top jobs in technology now require programming skills and so learning how to code can be a real career boost, but what is the best programming language to learn? The following list, based on databases of job vacancies for computer programmers, shows the programming languages most requested by employers. Choice of languages varies according to employiment sector. Banking systems need to perform complicated functions with minimal latency, requiring a language such as C++. Media - and design- related software - requires dynamic, versatile and functional languages with minimal code, such as Ruby, PHP and JavaScript.

### Python
Python is a general purpose programming language for website, mobile apps, desktop, SBC software and teaching. Python is simple and extremely readable since it closely resembles the words and syntax of the English language. Easy for beginners, yet it has also become the language of choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Python is so versatile that it is even regarded as the top competitor to the language of R.

### Java
Java is an **object-oriented** programming language developed in the 1990s. Used by over 9 million developers and running on 7 billion devices worldwide, it is one of the most in demand programming languages, a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the Android 'operating system'. Java is designed to work across multiple software platforms, meaning a program written on the Apple Mac could also run on Windows. Java's popularity with developers is due to its readability and simplicity.

### JavaScript
For many years, JavaScript has been regarded as the number one choice for making web pages interactive. For example, it can be used to add effects to web pages, display pop-up messages or to create games with basic functionality. JavaScript is the **scripting language** of the World Wide Web and is built into all major web browsers including Safari and Chrome. Today, it is also used to create apps for Android, iOS and desktop platforms.

### C++
'C-plus-plus'" is a general purpose programming language based on the earlier 'C' language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, C++ was first released in 1983. C++ powers major software like Firefox, Winamp and Adobe programs. It is used to develop system software, application software, high-performance server and client applications and video games. 

### C#
Dating from 2000. C# (pronouneed 'C-sharp") is a programming language designed by Microsoft for a wide range of **enterprise applications** that run on the .NET Framework. An evolution of C and C++, the C# language is a simple, general-purpose language used mostly to develop software for the Microsoft Windows OS.

### R
With the huge commercial interest in data science, the R programming arguably the best choice for developing statistical and data analysis software. From its simple statistical functions and built-in graphing ability, to the complex analysis packages available, it is used by Facebook, Google and Accenture.

### PHP
Originally created as a set of tools to help maintain a personal home page, PHP has since developed into a seripting language. It can be used to enhance web pages written in HTML for dynamic websites as well as for app development. PHP is easy to use and popular with new programmers, but it.

### Ruby
Like Java, Ruby is a general purpose programming language, though it is best known for its use in developing websites and mobile apps. Designed to be simple and easy to write, it is regarded as a user friendly language for beginners. Rails serves.as framework for Ruby and 'Ruby on Rails' is used by companies ranging from small start- ups to larga Interprises, including Hulu, Twitter and Groupon.

### Swift
In 2014, Apple decided to invent their own programming PHP language. The result was Swift: a new programming language for iOS and macOS. Developers using Swift find that many parts of it Ruby are familiar from their experience of developing in C++. Companies including American Airlines , Linkedin, and Uber have been quick to adopt Swift, and this language has since been increasing in importance.

### C 
A general-purpose programming language developed in the Python early '7Os, C is the oldest and most widely used language, providing the building blocks for other popular languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. C is mostly used for implementing operating systems and embedded applications. Because it provides the basis for so many other languages, it is a good idea to learn C before moving on to others.
