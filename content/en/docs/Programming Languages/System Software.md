## System Software
The software of a computer consists of the programs which tell the hardware what to do. There are two basic types: system software and application software, System software is a permanent component of the computer that controls essential functions and provides a platform for application software. Application software is user-oriented: it enables users to perform specific tasks such as editing a document or browsing the web. It relies on, and runs within, the environment provided by the system software.

## The operating System
A computer's **operating system** (OS) is the system software which manages the computer' resources and allows all the various hardware and software components to work together. Popular examples include "Microsoft Windows", "macOS" and "Linux". The OS controls the computer by performing basic essential tasks such as receiving data from the keyboard, displaying information on the screen or storing it in the memory. It works the whole time that the computer is switched on, and parts of it can be permanently stored in a computer's ROM. The OS allows the different application programs to run and make use of the computer' resources. Most applications are written to work with a particular OS. An advanced OS allows multiprocessing, in which several programs can run at the same time. A multiuser OS allows several different people to use the computer at the same time, usually connected through a network. The OS stores data in collections called 'files'. The file system of an OS allows programs to give names to files, and it keeps track of each file's location. The files can also be grouped together, for more convenience, into directories or folders.

## Other elements of the operating system

The OS controls a range of **utilities**, special programs designed to carry out specific maintenance tasks to keep the computer operating smoothly: for example, tidying up the hard drive or checking files for viruses. **Drivers** are OS programs linked to particular peripheral devices such as a printer or a mouse. The driver integrates the device into the computer system so that it can work with all the other elements. Modern operating systems provide a **graphical user interfare** (GUI) to make programs easier to use. Earlier systems required the user to type in written instructions to make the computer work. A GUI allows the user to control the computer, with the help of a mouse or touchpad, simply by moving, and clicking on, images or words on the screen.
