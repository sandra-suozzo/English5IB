## What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. This means creating algorithms to classify, analyze, and draw predictions from data. It also involves acting on data, learning from new data, and improving over time.

"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.‚Äù AI is a machine with the ability to solve problems that usually are done by humans using intelligence"

### The Original 7 Aspects of A.I (1955) 

1 Simulating higher functions of the human brain. 

2 Programming a computer to use general language. 

3 Arranging hy pothetical neurons in a manner so that they can form concepts. 

4 Awav to determine and measure problem complexity, 

5 Sell-improvement. 

6 Abstraction: Defined as the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. 

7 Randomness and creativity.
